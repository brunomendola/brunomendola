### Hello everybody!

I'm Bruno and I'm having **A LOT OF FUN** on GitHub!

In the daytime I try to make the world of ERPs cooler @ [Dedagroup Stealth](https://www.dedagroupstealth.com/).

You might remember me from such open source projects as **Querity**, the Java library to query any database... or not. Btw, that's what I'm doing here, so please take a look at [Querity](https://github.com/brunomendola/querity).

I occasionally contribute to open-source projects here on Github and I'm always VERY happy when I find a way to do so.
